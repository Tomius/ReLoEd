Land of Earth Reloaded
======================

This is a rewritten version of my original [Land of Earth](https://github.com/Tomius/LoE) project, with a different dataset representation and streaming method, resulting in better performance and visual quality.

Land of Earth is a global spherical terrain renderer that uses a 172800 * 86400 heightmap, is based on my engine [Silice3D](https://github.com/Tomius/Silice3D) and it works realtime. It is an "extension" of [Filip Strugar's CDLOD concept](http://www.vertexasylum.com/downloads/cdlod/cdlod_latest.pdf), with texture streaming of course. Unfortunately I couldn't upload the dataset required to run this code.
